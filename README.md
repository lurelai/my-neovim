# NVIM instalation manual
1. Install the NVIM(app image) by https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#appimage-universal-linux-package
2. Put the nvim.appimage at the ~/programs (to combine with my alias(see at https://github.com/lurelai/my-zsh-config))
3. Make a director at ~/./config/ named nvim (`mkdir ~/./config/nvim`)
4. Create a file named init.vim there (`touch init.vim`)
5. Put the "init.vim" from this repertory there
